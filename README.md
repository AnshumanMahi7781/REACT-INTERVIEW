###  2. What is Virtual DOM ?   
=> 
Virtual DOM is a concept of React, which is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual dom of a web page. When changes are made in React Component, a new Virtual DOM will created, then react calculates the difference between the new virtual dom and the previous one to update the actual DOM more efficiently, this process known as reconcilication. It improve the performance and speed of react application.

DOM stands for 'DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL", which  represents the document as a tree of objects, where each part of the web page, such as elements, attributes, and text content, is represented as an object in the tree.

### 3. What is difference between class and functional component ?  
=> 
Class components are defined using JavaScript classes, while functional components are JavaScript functions.

Class components can manage their own state using the this.state object. Functional components can manage state using React Hooks, such as useState, introduced in React 16.8 and later.

Class components have access to various lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. Functional components can replicate the behavior of lifecycle methods using Hooks like useEffect.

#### 4. What is package.json?  
=>
package.json is a file used in Node.js and JavaScript projects. It contains metadata about the project, including the project's name, version, dependencies, and various configuration settings. It's commonly used to manage project dependencies and scripts for tasks like building, testing, and running the application.

#### 5.What is JSX  

JSX stands for JavaScript XML, which an extension to JavaScript syntax that allow us to write HTML like code within our Js code, within working with React.  JSX is used in React to define the structure and layout of UI components. It makes it more readable and easier to write and maintain complex user interfaces. Browsers don't understand JSX directly, so it's transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel before it's executed in the browser.

#### 6.StateFull and stateless componet   

In react StateFull components refers to the Classbased component and stateless component refers to the functional component.

Statefull components have the ability to manage their own state data where stateless component does not manage their own state.stateless component rely on the data provided to them through props and do not have internal state.

Statefull componet does have access to React's lifecycle methods where stateless component don't have access to react's lifecycle methods.

Statefull compoonents are more suitable for components that require complex logic, data mangement or interactions with the server. where
  Stateless components are often used for presentation or UI components. They are concerned with how things look and are typically simpler and more focused on rendering.
